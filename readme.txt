== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= 1. What does this plugin do? =
This plugin adds a floating follow button to your blog/website, the same follow button which appears every on WP.COM blogs to collect email address and passes them to Mailchimp Email Subscription Service.

= 2. Why Follow Button =
Well, the answer is very simple. I and many of the Wordpress.org users(may be you too) are jealous of the follow button that appears on 
right bottom of all wordpress.com users. And I think why Wordpress.org users must be deprived from it.Thats It!

No
